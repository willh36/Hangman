Hello! 
I've worked through the game and added multiple necessary improvements.

1. The player lives count can no longer go into negative figures. 
2. I've removed some unnecessary variables to make the code simpler to understand. 
3. I've commented more code for improved code interpretation ease. 
4. I've fixed minor bugs such as:
     - Incorrect guess info displaying when the lives count has expired 
     - Players on 0 lives having the ability to make a guess

Hopefully it all runs smoothly and without any issues!
